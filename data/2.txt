History of Present Illness:
61F w/ sign PMH for UC s/p colectomy, Stage II breast cancer
presented on day 13 of second cycle of chemotherapy with fever
to 100.6 at home w/ severe rigors. She took two Ibuprofen at
home and then went to onc clinic today where she was then
referred to the ED for admission. She stated that for the past
two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in
her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her
stool. She has had nausea but similar to how she has felt in the
past with chemo. She also mentioned that she recently cut her
finger in the garden on Sunday which is now red and slightly
tender to the touch. She otherwise denies any vomiting, rash,
rhinorrhea, dysuria, cough, SOB or abdominal discomfort. She
denies any recent travel or sick contacts as well.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, Temp: 101 ??????F (38.3 ??????C), Pulse: 93,
RR: 16, BP: 77/38, O2Sat: 94, O2Flow: RA. Her labs were notable
for WBC of 0.7 and PMN count of 21. Her U/A was bland and two
blood cultures were obtained and are pending. His CXR did not
show definitive source of infection either. She was started on
Cefepime for neutropenic fever. While in the ED she developed
hypotension not responding to IVF boluses, the pt denied CVL
placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine
peripherially in order to maintain SBPs in the 90s-100s. She did
not have a change in her mentation during these episodes of
hypotension.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she was mentating normally and answering
questions appropriately. She was in NAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.  is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not
concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. The following day after
admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and
he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension- In the  pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding
to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and
peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher
BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She
was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.
# Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ,

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at . You were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
()

You should discuss with Dr.  the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.
